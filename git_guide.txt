To get a git repository onto your computer, go to the repository's page on Github then click the green "clone" button and copy the url. In your terminal, type git clone <url> to download it.

After you've modified the repo (by adding or editing files), you must stage your changes. This is accomplished by typing git add <filename> in the terminal. If you want to just add everything, you can type git add -A

You must commit your changes using git commit. Commiting basically means that you have finished a "batch" of changes. A commit becomes an entry in the history log of your repo. When you type git commit, a text editor will open automatically for you to write a message to describe your commit, because you must attach a message to your commit. (when done, type ESC :wq)

You can write a message and commit at the same time by typing git commit -m 'this is my commit message'.

To sync your new commit(s) to Github, you type git push then type your Github credentials in the prompt.

To fetch the latest changes and synchronize your repo with Github, type git pull.

Yay :) :>
